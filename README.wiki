A tiny Python script to convert a plaintext file into a MediaWiki wiki page (as wikitext), avoiding the issue that subsequent lines blend into one because MediaWiki treats newlines differently.

Basically, it adds "<code><<nowiki />br /></code>" tags to the end of every line of the input file, except those where MediaWiki will keep the line break anyway when parsing it as wikitext (e.g. after a line that starts with "*").

I use it to publish notes taken on an Etherpad (exported from Etherpad as plaintext file) on Meta-wiki.

'''Usage''': wikibrs.py inputfile.txt outputfile.txt

To avoid getting yourself into trouble when using this for Wikipedia articles, consider looking at the essay "[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Don't_use_line_breaks Don't use line breaks"] first ;)
